# ESP32
Getting Started with the ESP32 Development Board
The ESP32 is a popular choice for implementing Internet of Things (IoT) projects due to its low cost, small size, and low power consumption. It has a dual-core microprocessor, built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity, and a variety of peripherals such as ADC, DAC, and touch sensors. It can be programmed using the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or using the Espressif IoT Development Framework (ESP-IDF).
Some common applications of the ESP32 include home automation, wearable electronics, industrial control, and smart appliances. It is also commonly used as a development board for prototyping and testing new IoT applications.
